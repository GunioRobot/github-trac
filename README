======================================================================================================

The commit hook is designed to close or mark tickets that are attached to a commit message.


It searches commit messages for text in the form of:
    command #1
    command #1, #2
    command #1 & #2 
    command #1 and #2

Instead of the short-hand syntax "#1", "ticket:1" can be used as well, e.g.:
    command ticket:1
    command ticket:1, ticket:2
    command ticket:1 & ticket:2 
    command ticket:1 and ticket:2
